Two deletions (three nucleotides and twenty-four nucleotides) were in the ORF1ab polyprotein, and one deletion (ten nucleotides) was in the 3′ end of the genome. Ninety-three mutations over the entire genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1). Forty-two missense mutations were identified in all the major non-structural and structural proteins, except the envelope protein. Twenty-nine missense mutations were in the ORF1ab polyprotein, eight in the spike surface glycoprotein, one in the matrix protein, and four in the nucleocapsid protein. Of note, three mutations (D354, Y364, and F367) located in the spike surface glycoprotein receptor-binding domain",,Gene Sequencing,86.0,

Spike segment S orf has 13 amino acid residue substitutions. orf6 and orf7b are the most conserved regions without amino acid changes. orf1O, E, M and orf7a are more conserved, with only one or two amino acid substitutions. Our phylogenetic tree demonstrates that BetaCoV/Chongqing/YC01/2020 is the closest SARS-CoV-2 to bat CoV (Bat/Yunnan/RaTG13) as compared to the first reported SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1_MN9O8947). Taking BetaCoV/Chongqing/YC01/2020 as a reference group, South Korea SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/South_Korea/SNU01/2020) has 7 amino acid substitutions in six orfs (S, E, orf1a, orf31, and orf8). BetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH-001/2020 has total of 16 amino acid substitutions in four coding regions with highest substitution of 11 amino acid residues in orf1a. United States of America (USA) SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/USA/MA1/2020) has 5 amino acid substitutions in N, orf1a, orf1ab, and orf8. France CoV (BetaCoV/France/IDF0571/2020) has 3 amino acid mutations in orf1a and 1 amino acid mutation in orf8.",,Phylogenetic analysis,125.0,
