1,2020-04-19,"A rapid review of evidence of infection of pets and livestock with human-associated coronavirus diseases, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, and evidence of the fomite potential of pets and livestock",SYREAF,http://www.syreaf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rapid-Review-of-pets-as-fomites_3.pdf,Systematic Review,"cats, dogs, ferrets, pigs, chickens, ducks",,,"Infected ferrets, infected cats, infected dogs","There is evidence from seeder models that cats and ferrets can become infected with SARSCoV-2 and this is detectable using PCR. There is evidence that cats in Wuhan, China have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 which appears to have developed after the outbreak. Dogs may become infected and produce antibodies, but there is no evidence that they develop clinical disease if exposed, or that they shed virus which may pose a risk to humans."
